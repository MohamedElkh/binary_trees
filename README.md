## 📃 Description

In this project, we explore the world of binary trees using the C programming language. We delve into the concepts, implementation, and manipulation of binary trees, including fundamental operations like insertion, traversal, and deletion. By mastering these concepts, we deepen our understanding of essential data structures and algorithms.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `binary_tree.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and struct definitions.
- `binary_tree_print.c`: File responsible for printing binary trees.
- `binary_tree_insert.c`: File containing functions to insert nodes into the binary tree.
- `binary_tree_delete.c`: File with functions to delete nodes from the binary tree.
- `binary_tree_traverse.c`: File holding functions to traverse the binary tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

## 🚀 Usage

To compile the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-trees-project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd binary-trees-project`
3. Compile the code: `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o binary_tree`

After compilation, run the executable to interact with binary trees:

```bash
./binary_tree
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations on binary trees.
